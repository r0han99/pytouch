## Description
    This utility when executed will automatically fills the import statements required for a python file for your work, I wrote this code-contraption only because I was annoyed of writting the same import lines for multiple python files 

## Usage

```bash
    # pre-setting the imports in log file (like a local db)
    pytouch --set
```
##### Creating Python files with import statements

```bash
    
    pytouch --file greyscalefigure.py image+processing.py
```
## Installation 
##### Linux + MacOS

```bash
    cd Linux+Mac/
    bash setup.sh
```

##### Windows : underdev
